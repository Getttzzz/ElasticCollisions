### What is it?
This is my attempt to recreate an [Elastic collision](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/184-elastic-collisions) code challenge in a small Android app. The idea is taken from a popular community of p5.js lovers from Dan Shiffman lesson and his site [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/). Huge thank you Dan Shiffman for inspiring me to reinvent joy of coding again.

### What is an elastic collision?
An elastic collision is a collision in which there is no net loss in kinetic energy in the system as a result of the collision. Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved quantities in elastic collisions.

### What's so special in this implementation?
There's no phisical engine under the hood. Everything is pretty much simple. The vectors of velocity, acceleration and position are calculated based on derevation formula of elastic collision in two dimensional space: <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd5efa46-e246-46a0-bdb2-d59d02cd9ead" />
