### What is it?
This is my attempt to recreate an elastic collision in a small Android app. The idea is taken from a popular community of p5.js lovers from Dan Shiffman lesson and his site [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/184-elastic-collisions). Huge thank you Dan Shiffman for inspiring me to reinvent joy of coding again.

### What is an elastic collision?
An elastic collision is a collision in which there is no net loss in kinetic energy in the system as a result of the collision. Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved quantities in elastic collisions.
